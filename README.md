      30pts:
        These constitute the top layer.
    There will be 11 aliens on each row.
    There will also be a bonus point 'mother ship' that will occationaly 
    travel accross the top of the screen, above all the aliens this will be worth 100pts.
      Bombs:
        There will be 2 types of projectile, shot (fast) and bomb (slow).
				
  Player:
    The player will only be able to move right and left.
    Shots will only come from the center of the player character, this makes the game harder.
    The player will have 3 'lives' in total, each time the player 'dies' there will be a short explosion animation.
	
  Barracade:
    There will be 4 barricades in total, each time a shot hits a barricade a 'chunk' will be taken out of it.
  
  Projectiles:
    There will be 3 types of projecties in total:
		The 2 bomb types of the Aliens, mentioned earlier.
		The last type is the type the player will be able to 'shoot'.
